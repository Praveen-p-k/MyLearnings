# CL3 Browser Extension

CL3 supports Firefox, Google Chrome, and Chromium-based browsers. We recommend using the latest available browser version.

## Building locally

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 16
  - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.
- Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `yarn dist`.
  - Optionally, you may run `yarn start` to run dev mode.

Uncompressed/compressed builds can be found in `/dist` once they're built.

## Contributing
